//! Abstract syntax tree representation of hugr modules.
//!
//! This module defines the abstract syntax tree for hugr graphs. The AST types
//! implement [`Display`] and [`FromStr`] for pretty printing into and parsing
//! from the s-expression based hugr text form. This is useful for debugging and
//! writing hugr modules by hand. For a more performant serialization format, see
//! [binary] instead.
//!
//! The data types in this module logically mirror those of the [table]
//! representation, but are encoded differently. Instead of using ids, the AST
//! data structure is recursive and uses names for symbols, variables and links.
//! [`Term`]s, [`Node`]s and [`Region`]s can be referred to individually in this
//! form, whereas the table form requires them to be seen in the context of a
//! module. An AST module can be translated into a table module via [`Module::resolve`].
//! This representation makes different efficiency tradeoffs than the table
//! form by using standard heap based data structures instead of a bump
//! allocated arena. This is slower but considerably more ergonomic.
//!
//! [binary]: crate::v0::binary
//! [table]: crate::v0::table
//! [`Display`]: std::fmt::Display
//! [`FromStr`]: std::str::FromStr
