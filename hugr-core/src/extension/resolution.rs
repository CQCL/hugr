//! Utilities for resolving operations and types present in a HUGR, and updating
//! the list of used extensions. The functionalities of this module can be
//! called from the type methods [`crate::Hugr::resolve_extension_defs`],
//! [`crate::ops::OpType::used_extensions`], and
//! [`crate::types::Signature::used_extensions`].
//!
//! When listing "used extensions" we only care about _definitional_ extension
//! requirements, i.e., the operations and types that are required to define the
//! HUGR nodes and wire types. This is computed from the union of all extension
//! required across the HUGR.
//!
//! Note: These procedures are only temporary until `hugr-model` is stabilized.
//! Once that happens, hugrs will no longer be directly deserialized using serde
//! but instead will be created by the methods in `crate::import`. As these
//! (will) automatically resolve extensions as the operations are created,
//! we will no longer require this post-facto resolution step.
