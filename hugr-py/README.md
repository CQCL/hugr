The Hierarchical Unified Graph Representation (HUGR, pronounced _hugger_) is the
common representation of quantum circuits and operations in the Quantinuum
ecosystem.

This library provides a pure-python implementation of the HUGR data model, and
a low-level API for constructing HUGR objects.

This library is intended to be used as a dependency for other high-level tools.
See [`guppylang`][] and [`tket2`][] for examples of such tools.

The HUGR specification is [here](https://github.com/CQCL/hugr/blob/main/specification/hugr.md).
